The neighborhood, especially the part closest to the  old port , was formerly (informally) known as  Barri Xinès  or  Barrio Chino , meaning \" Chinatown \". [1]  El Raval is one of the two historical neighborhoods that border  La Rambla , the other being the  Barri Gòtic ; it contains some 50,000 people.\n\nAn area historically infamous for its nightlife and cabarets, as well as prostitution and crime, El Raval has changed significantly in recent years and due to its central location has become a minor attraction of Barcelona. It currently has a very diverse immigrant community (47.4% of its population was born abroad, ranging from all  South America ,  Pakistanis  and  Filipinos , to a more recent  Eastern European  community, especially from  Romania ). It is home to many bars, restaurants, and night spots.\n"

Surrounding the extensive cluster of factories stood mostly working class residential areas. When the industrial buzz passed, the neighborhood fell into a state of abandon and after a period of decay, the neighborhood underwent a dramatic transformation. The  Olympic Games  in 1992 were the main trigger for this massive transformation of El Poblenou.

The Galvany name became popular when the market Galvany was built, located between the neighborhood streets Santaló, Calaf, Amigó and Madrazo, and the market has a plaque on the facade of Santaló street recalling that Josep Galvany Castelló gave the land on which the market was built to the municipality.\n\nIt occupies the area between Av.

Its non-official centre, the  marketplace  of the same name—designed by  Antoni Rovira i Trias  and built between 1872 and 1882—is one of the oldest and most popular in the city, especially with the secondhand book stalls that surround the building Sunday mornings. It is bordered by the neighbourhoods of the  L'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample  (on the other side of  Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes ), the  Raval  (on the other side of  Ronda de Sant Antoni ), and  Poble Sec  (on the other side of  Avinguda del Paral·lel ). The streets of Sant Antoni follow the grid pattern prevalent in all of Eixample, except for a central thoroughfare, the  Avinguda de Mistral , built on the site of an important medieval road which led out of Barcelona. Another well-known landmark of Sant Antoni is the bar called  Els Tres Tombs , right next to the market.\n\nAlthough its origins are tied to the now-disappeared Church of Saint Anthony (in  Catalan :  Sant Antoni ) in the Raval, the development of the neighbourhood dates from the 1880s onwards, as Barcelona expanded beyond its former medieval walls. Very few houses stood around the market when it was built, and most buildings visible today in Sant Antoni date of the 1920s and 1930s, when major urban changes occurred in the city on the occasion of the  1929 International Exposition . A working-class area during most of the 20th century, it has undergone important changes in the last decades. As with many other neighbourhoods in central Barcelona, some gentrification has taken place in Sant Antoni since the 1980s and  prostitution  has mostly relocated since. Nowadays it is one of the quietest areas in the city centre, with 37,878 inhabitants in the 2005 census. The Mercat de Sant Antoni has been refurbished recently. In the meantime, this Ronda Sant Antoni has become pedestrianised.\n"

The neighborhood was constructed during the 18th century for the residents of the  Ribera neighborhood  who had been displaced by the construction of the  Ciutadella of Barcelona .  The neighborhood is roughly triangular, bordered by the  Mediterranean Sea , the  Moll d'Espanya  of  Port Vell , and the  El Born  neighborhood.  This neighborhood has its own flag, and is serviced by its own stop on the  Barcelona Metro line 4 . This is a good starting point for whatever itinerary there may be to adventure through La Barceloneta. The yellow line, L4, which is the metro line that stops at La Barceloneta, is the most popular for pickpocketing. The neighborhood can also be discovered by taking Las Gorondrinas, [1]  which leave from the front port of the  Columbus monument . This way the marine strip can be discovered, but the real charm of this neighborhood is by getting lost in the side streets or alleyways.  Torre Sant Sebastià  is the terminus of the  Port Vell Aerial Tramway ; opened in 1931, it connects La Barceloneta with  Montjuïc  across Port Vell.\n\nLa Barceloneta is known for its sandy beach (which made an appearance in  Don Quixote , book 2) and its many restaurants and nightclubs along the boardwalk. Over the past several years the quality of the sand on the beach has become a source of continued controversy.  In February 2008,  the  World Health Organization  began an inquiry designed to ascertain whether the sand meets WHO beach health and safety guidelines.\n"
