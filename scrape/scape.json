The neighborhood was constructed during the 18th century for the residents of the  Ribera neighborhood  who had been displaced by the construction of the  Ciutadella of Barcelona .  The neighborhood is roughly triangular, bordered by the  Mediterranean Sea , the  Moll d'Espanya  of  Port Vell , and the  El Born  neighborhood.  This neighborhood has its own flag, and is serviced by its own stop on the  Barcelona Metro line 4 . This is a good starting point for whatever itinerary there may be to adventure through La Barceloneta. The yellow line, L4, which is the metro line that stops at La Barceloneta, is the most popular for pickpocketing. The neighborhood can also be discovered by taking Las Gorondrinas,   which leave from the front port of the  Columbus monument . This way the marine strip can be discovered, but the real charm of this neighborhood is by getting lost in the side streets or alleyways.  Torre Sant Sebastià  is the terminus of the  Port Vell Aerial Tramway ; opened in 1931, it connects La Barceloneta with  Montjuïc  across Port Vell.",
